For example, instead of playing a generic memory game, your parent can use her own pictures of family and neighborhood maps as part of her personalized training program.  Training with relevant content that the patient is connected with is much more effective than one-size-fits-all approaches. \n\nUsing the information gathered from each patient's performance and clinical data, we train our proprietary machine learning algorithm to identify optimal learning strategies. This enables us to leverage functional brain networks of each patient to overcome shortcomings due to neurological disease."}

It’s like having the power of instantly making any type of jacket appear or disappear, always at the right moment.\n\nWith a mixture of state of the art robotics and textiles, we were able to replicate nature's ability to regulate temperature, specifically of that of plants. Instead of trying to make the hot and humid air leave the body through the tight windproof membrane, as companies like The North Face try to do, we will open this barrier creating a much freer path for air to flow. \n\nThe result: our jacket is able to release two times more excess heat than the most breathable jacket in the market. This technology will bring great benefits to the winter sport users, usually affected by large variations in activity levels and extreme ambient conditions."}

As we leverage the multiplex and high-throughput nature of next-generation sequencing, we can analyze hundreds of different samples in parallel, drastically minimizing costs.  With far reaching applications in cancer diagnostics, blood analyses, early disease detection, and precision medicine the potential for MYi to revolutionize medicine is high.

At Education Data Solutions we have crafted a system that prepares data for human analysis in a way that most districts cannot conjure up themselves. EDS computes student growth multiple ways allowing districts to choose the method of analysis that best meets the purpose of the assessment. In addition, EDS organizes the mass of data that districts house in a manner that allows individual users from the superintendent of schools to a classroom teacher to see the impact their instruction has on student growth."}

This would also bypass personnel and administrative headaches that is endemic to the employer/employee relationship.

Browsing through profiles or IMing with @Mr/MsRight246 is a time suck that usually leads to a dead end. Now you’re tired of talking about dating. Of swiping, winking, ghosting, and bageling. \n\nBrushPass is a mobile dating app that uses a compatibility algorithm and user’s proximity to find a match and set up a quick in-person interaction at a nearby cafe or bar. BrushPass’s value proposition lies in transforming and enhancing online dating by significantly reducing time when the match is found and when the two people meet live (2 hours) and increasing the likelihood of a live meeting by eliminating profiles and picture-driven biases and arranging a mutually convenient location walking distance away."}

Using our solution, a device designer connects to a hardware wireless modem like a web server- using HTTP calls.  The same HTTP calls are made no matter what the network (LTE, 3G, WiFi, SigFox, and even 5G when it is available).  Modems can be swapped out at any time to connect to a different network.  In this way, devices can have the optimal connectivity wherever they are, at any point in the product lifecycle.  Getting back to the Tesla example, if Tesla used Wivity the upgrade cost would be \u003c$100. \n\nWith Wivity, building connectivity into an IoT device is just like connecting to a web server.  \"Twilio for the Internet of Things.\""}

The sales approach is often a high-pressure emotional game. Clarity Memorial will allow consumers to plan and purchase a funeral completely online, in the privacy of their own homes. Our site provides up-front pricing and simplified options.\n\nMost funeral homes hold their services in dated mortuary buildings connected to their embalming and crematory facilities. Clarity Memorial will instead create Care Centers akin to contemporary retail storefronts. We’ll partner with existing mortuaries to rent usage of their facilities for preparing the remains when needed, and we’ll host the services in modern event spaces like halls, ballrooms, gardens, private homes, or churches."}

Even when we bring chargers, we’re constantly on the hunt for that elusive outlet.\n\nEnter Doblet. We’ve built a network of super-portable chargers that fully charges your phone in under an hour, wherever you happen to be. Whether you’re at your favorite bar or restaurant, on vacation at the beach, taking part in a startup conference, or even doing jury duty, we’ve got you covered. Just ask your bartender or concierge for a Doblet, plug it into your phone, and get back to doing what you do best."}

It processes those samples to extract biospecimen such as cells, serum, plasma and DNA, and stores them along with the medical data. It then sells the biospecimen and data to academic and pharmaceutical entities for research purposes.  \n\nProblem \u0026 Solution:\nTraditionally, research companies need to wait for physicians to set up appointments with patients and to find some willing to sign up. Patients go to Sanguine because Sanguine offers increased transparency in the research process, showing them where samples are used and how they advance biomedical research in areas they care about."}

Instead, fans have to search across multiple sources (social networks, youtube, publications etc.) and too many types of content (pics, tweets, feeds, videos, flows, etc.). The result is that fans miss critical content, waste time searching and cannot effectively share or discover content.\n \nMelody enables fans to follow, discover and share content by aggregating all social feeds, articles and videos in one place. It solves the issue of missed content while enabling the sharing of content to new and existing social graphs. To be clear, Melody is not a streaming service but a free, ubiquitous platform that is open to everyone.\n \nWe are creating affinity targeting at scale. We are starting with music but building the platform to extend to other verticals such as sports, celebrity, and film."}

Through a monthly subscription offering, we bring the golf tee right to the golfer's door, offering convenience and affordability. Packs are designed to include a tee for every club in the bag.\n\nThere's no question of value. We make it quick and easy to order. Our golfers can update, skip a delivery, or cancel at their leisure. \n\nOur golf tees are made from recycled industrial scraps in The USA. They're tough, built to last substantially longer than wooden tees and other cheap plastic tees on the market. Golfers will use fewer, buy less, and approach the tee box in style. \n \nThe reduced resistance technology provides our golfers with less contact with the tee. This results in reduced ball spin, a higher and faster launch off the tee box, and increase roll. While we never claim to shave strokes off of your score card, we'll promise to deliver a product that won't let you down."}

Since the invention of TV, technology has forced broadcasters and MSOs to target broad audiences simultaneously, introducing significant content risk, impeding advertisers, and leaving viewers underwhelmed.

After too many unfulfilling meals at the end of long work days, we insisted there be a better option. Instead of choosing between quick, greasy takeout or elaborate, expensive restaurants, Sprig combines the best of both into wholesome, delicious, convenient food you can trust.\n\nWe launched in November 2013 serving dinner to one neighborhood in San Francisco. Our customers immediately connected with our vision and word spread quickly. A year and a half later we’ve served over half a million meals to customers across San Francisco and Chicago. Now we're focused on bringing Sprig nationwide, and ultimately worldwide, because everyone deserves to eat well.\n\nYelp: http://www.yelp.com/biz/sprig-dinner-on-demand-san-francisco-2\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sprig"}

The mobile shift has already moved email to messaging. It will move Docs to collaborative notes. Pingpad is the first app natively designed for this Social Productivity opportunity, filling the gap between personal productivity and document-centric enterprise collaboration.

Today, they are now responsible for 30% (mostly in the form of difficult to determine high deductibles and co-insurances).\n\nUnfortunately, provider organizations are ill equipped to deal with this fundamental shift in payment flow. As a result, they are experiencing an unprecedented growth in patient bad debt, now a $100B problem. Medlio is solving this problem by pushing patient collections to the front of the revenue cycle.\n\nMedlio’s web-based application for providers accurately estimates the cost of patient encounters before they occur, so patient-responsible balances can be collected on the front-end of a visit, prior to service. Medlio's patent-pending solution is perfectly scalable and requires near-zero implementation effort."}

In the background, it will be measuring steps taken every day. The wearable device can synchronize to a mobile application to download daily steps / active minute data and upload the data to a cloud for remote data retrieval anywhere around the world.\n\nAll the current medical alert systems are sold in the US and all look like plastic appliances that stigmatize the elderly wearing it. Simple Wearable’s product will have a more modern and discreet look that connects the socially isolated elderly to their loved ones, while at the same time creating a habit of movement because we remove the fear of falling."}

Our CTO was the target's head of engineering until YE2013. His modular next generation version supports the RaaS model. \n\nTelepresence robots allow a person to feel as if they are present in a remote location with the people at that location feeling he is actually there! It enables face-to-face communications, bridging the physical divide whether you are down the hall, or around the world. This is a vital tool for large enterprises as well as anyone separated by distance. \n\nRaaS extends cloud-based services via robotic mobility without needing to build and manage connected robots. New businesses will evolve from this platform."}
